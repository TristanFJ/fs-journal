- When using Media Query, be mindful of the position of your queries and any other rules to apply. Our instructor had a bug when trying to demonstrate Media Query, where the background color was applied after the query and so it was like the media query didn't even exist. Remember, it's Cascading Style Sheets, specificity is important, the order is important.
