## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

The overall quality of the interaction between your product and your audience. What the user wants to do with your product should be considered, so that we can allow them to do what they want as easily as possible. 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Users return to apps that have a pleasant user experience. So if you don't take it into account, and it's not a pleasant user experience, nobody's going to benefit from your product. 

3. Why is the User Experience important?

Nobody's going to stick around with your product if it's a pain to navigate and use.
