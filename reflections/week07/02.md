> **ðŸ“– [Code Documentation for JavaScript](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk7/02-JSDocs)**

## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Explaining in plain language how code is working and why it was written that way. 

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

You can preserve your understanding of your own code and also share that understanding with your fellow developers. And with something like JSDocs you can get intellisense to assist you while you're programming. 

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Up to date and explanatory documentation can be as important as the code itself when it comes to maintaining and adding onto existing code. That's because what you wrote a month ago won't always make sense to you now, and programming is a team sport where sharing your understanding of a problem is critical to the iterative improvement of code.
