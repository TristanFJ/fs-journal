# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

All of them in some sense, with documentation being the least implemented. 

2. What went well this week?

We hit most of the requirements, and the ones we missed seem to be a quick fix so I'm not disappointed with my group. 

3. What would you do differently?

Three people is an interesting dynamic. I think we should have had pair programming of two, and the third person works independently, and rotate like that. I think we lost time by having two navigators and one driver, and swapping out randomly.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Teaching others helps me learn, and everyone has something to teach, but it can also be tiring and not the fastest method, which is fine.
