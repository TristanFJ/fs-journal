## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
They reduce boilerplate around promises so you can have asynchronous code without sacrificing cleanliness. In other words, it can look synchronous but really be asynchronous. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
You must prepend await before the function. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
Much easier to read, and It's very easy to chain async functions. And as it appears synchronous it can be easier to debug.
