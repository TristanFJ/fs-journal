## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
Representational state transfer. It's like passing the client a copy of a resource without modifying the original. 
2. What does Stateless mean?
It doesn't remember anything. It will respond with what's needed regardless of how many times it's asked, etc. 
3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
URLs should include nouns, not verbs. Use plural nouns only for consistency. Use HTTP methods to operate on these resources. Use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.
