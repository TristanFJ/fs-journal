> **üìñ [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

When a function or block of code is nested very deeply, has a pyramid shape or many closing brackets. It's poor programming practice. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means things aren't always sequential, something might take some time or complete in the future and you need a way for this to process while also doing other things so your code doesn't seize up. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keep your code shallow and name things descriptively and hoist them when advantageous. ‚ÄúWrite small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. You can‚Äôt get into callback hell if you don‚Äôt go there.‚Äù - Isaac Schlueter. Handle errors, where the first callback argument is reserved for error. Fail first.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

.sort() can be used to "shuffle" an array, so that the correct answer from an API isn't the last in the array each time. This would have helped me solve the multiple choice dilemma.
