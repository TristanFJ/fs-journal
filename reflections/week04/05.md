# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

API's are very exciting to use. It's very interesting to be able to dynamically CRUD information from a database. 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

You can perform equations in a model, so like on my weather api I pulled in kelvin and set this.temp to the kelvin, and then I created this.fah and this.cel on the same model and used this.temp to do the maths to get fahrenheit and celsius. 

- What are you struggling with?

Sometimes I would forget to create models and so I'd be trying to use POJOs, but that doesn't work. Using the debugger is helpful for this. 

- What would you count as a victory?

I think I'm doing well using APIs, and it feels like I'm starting to get the hang of the MVC pattern. Sometimes I would put logic in my controller on accident and then realized I need to put that in the service and use the controller to call that logic.
