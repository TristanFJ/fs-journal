## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
Pending, Resolved, Rejected. 
2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
You can use them to create asynchronous code that waits for promises to be resolved, or rejected, before continuing. Attaching callbacks to promises and chaining makes the code cleaner. 
3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
If a promise is successful, THEN we do this next step, after the promise is resolved. If it fails, then we catch the failure or rejection. It's similar to if else.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Be mindful of including every data property that you need in a model. At one point I had bedrooms but no bathrooms and it was rejected. Also of course be very mindful of typos like plural instead of singular. That caught me once again.
