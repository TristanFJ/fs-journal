## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo-class is like a subset of a selector. So for example you could have an anchor tag with pseudoclasses of a:hover or a:active, which will activate different stylings for those respective states. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is part of the cascading nature of CSS, and it is the logic that decides what is applied when there are multiple potential modifications. It's useful to understand because the rules at the bottom aren't always what's applied, according to specificity. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Specificity would stop working as you think at first glance, and you'd have to look closely. The problem compounds when there are multiple developers who are unsure of where importants have been used justifiably, and which importants are unnecessary.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
My code seems to work well on Chrome, but not Firefox. Design with the browsers in mind. Flexbox is powerful and I need to understand it more. I think it would be useful on the bottom blue border, but I'm not totally sure how to apply it. Something with flex grow maybe.
