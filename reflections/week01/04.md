## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wire-framing helps mentally plan what the development process will look like. This could be detailing what will be a row and what will be a column, what kind of CSS classes you'll need to accomplish specific portions of the design, or what parts of the design will need particular attention or tweaking. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are low, medium, and high fidelity wire-framing processes. You start off with low-fidelity to group the most basic things and you work your way up to the more detail oriented design choices. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

They are definitely worth it if you're approaching a project with any kind of complexity. If you don't plan beforehand, it very well could mean spending a lot of time on something that ends up being discarded, so the planning with wire-frames saves you time in the end.
