# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I had a little experience with Bootstrap before so it was really nice to flesh out my knowledge and practice more. The container, row, column format is really interesting and helpful for building out the layout. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Some of the responsive bootstrap classes, like hiding certain elements on specific widths didn't make sense at first but once you get the hang of it it's very helpful for responsive design. 

- What are you struggling with?

Sometimes the container, row, column nesting can be confusing, but it helps to collapse sections when you're done with them. 

- What would you count as a victory?

At first I struggled a little bit with putting text and a card over an image, but once I get help and realized how to put it as a background image it felt very good to set up. Definitely something to remember for the future.
