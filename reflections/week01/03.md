## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Use the developer tools to see where your margin, padding, and everything is at. Sometimes it's different than you imagine, and you can also tweak it from inside the tools. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- https://materialdesignicons.com/ 

- https://getbootstrap.com/ 

- https://fonts.google.com/

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

It seems that design matters as much, if not more, than the content itself. If the design is impossible to read then nobody's going to stick around to try and decipher what's happening. Using secondary colors to display less important things can be better than making the text smaller, for example.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Nesting rows is very powerful, but don't nest a row inside a row, or a col inside a col. Alternate between row and column. Another thing I've considered is I forgot to design from a mobile-first perspective, so on large screens it looks okay but completely breaks down on smaller. This is even a strength of using Bootstrap, if you can remember to implement it.
