## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to one. One to many. Many to many. 

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

You might hit the storage max, and write performance is less efficient. You also couldn't use pagination. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Mainly the storage limit when pairing the relationships together. Some relationships may be "lopsided" and different relationship configurations will do better.
