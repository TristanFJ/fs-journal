# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I'm finding data relationships to be pretty interesting, and I'm becoming more comfortable with the server side of things. 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

Planning a group project is harder than expected. 

- What are you struggling with?

Our team didn't accomplish everything we imagined. I think we chose something harder to implement than we imagined. 

- What would you count as a victory?

Got more practice on both front and back end.
