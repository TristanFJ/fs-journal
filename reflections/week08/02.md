## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

The smaller the team, the less man hours being applied to an application, so being efficient in communication reduces time spent on meetings, and increases time spent coding.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Expand the scope of communications during your meetings and map out the details. Make adjustments and compromises where needed. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

Good, fast, cheap. You can't have them all. Pick two.
