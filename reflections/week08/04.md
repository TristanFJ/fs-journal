## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing (individual units in isolation), component testing (Vue conveniences like Vue router), end to end testing (all layers of application). 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Probably E2E because it tests the entire application as the user will experience it, but it can also take longer. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Maybe component testing, but I don't fully understand how component testing is different from unit testing.
