## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It showcases what you've accomplished and what you're capable of creating. It can make you stand out from other candidates and increase your personal brand.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Quality projects are the defining feature of a portfolio. Demonstrate that you can solve real-world problems, and show them off in your portfolio. You can even write about your journey with each application.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

My capstone project once it's done. I would include the Tower application, but I need to improve the UI. I'm pretty happy with how my inspire dashboard works, I might create a version two with my own server and other API's.
