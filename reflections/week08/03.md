## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Testing the functionality of code, in small and simple ways so that you don't have to test the entire application.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

Testing increases your confidence that your components are working. Unit tests force you to think about edge cases. You can iterate more efficiently by conducting your own simple tests instead of waiting for a separate team to test it. 

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

You now have to maintain the tests when you maintain the corresponding code, but this could be seen as good or bad.
