# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

We got most of our phase one minimum viable product complete so that's exciting. 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

Learned more about the differences between reactive and ref.

- What are you struggling with?

Some back end stuff is still confusing. We lost a lot of time trying to handle multiple different but seemingly similar id's.

- What would you count as a victory?
