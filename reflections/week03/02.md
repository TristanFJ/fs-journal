## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Creating specific restrictions on data and data processing, or Alan Kay described it as "local retention and protection and hiding of state-process". It's similar to single responsibility, only allowing access to what truly needs access. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

The underscore prefix convention isn't always a known convention, and therefore may not be viable for all developers to understand and maintain. Or an experienced developer may understand the purpose of the underscore, but use it in an inappropriate way anyways. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You create a locally scoped variable inside a class and then create a new instance of that class to manipulate the variable. This enforces true encapsulation instead of conventional encapsulation.
