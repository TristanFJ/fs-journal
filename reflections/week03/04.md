> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

One-to-many, and one-way event-driven data binding. Waiting for changes and then performing actions based on those changes. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subscribe (adds new observable events), unsubscribe (removes observable events), broadcast (executes all events with bound data). 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

ProxyState is almost like a bridge between multiple modules that it can listen to for changes, and you can use to update changes dynamically.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Drawing dynamic HTML with templates and interpolation is very neat and powerful. I don't totally understand ProxyState but it seems to be super helpful for listening and updating things upon change.
