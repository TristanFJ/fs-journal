## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

An ordered collection of types that can be manipulated, distinct from an array which can't be easily manipulated. 

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

Add, Count, Index, Contains, a lot of the methods I'm used to using in JavaScript are carried over but with different names. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

Index if I knew the position or BinarySearch if I didn't, but had another property. Maybe Find.
