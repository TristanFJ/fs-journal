> **ðŸ“– [C# Enums](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/03-Enums)**

## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. You can use them to assign symbolic names to integral values, like North South East and West to 0123 respectively. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?

Similar to modifying an object. Type name = Type.enum 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have in Node but not C#. I think I could use them for recipe categories in AllSpice if I wanted to set them server side.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

C# servers are different than I'm used to and they take a bit to set up but they follow a familiar pattern once you get used to it.
