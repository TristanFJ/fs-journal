## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type (holds a data value within its memory space), reference type (stores the address where the value is being stored), pointer type (does not inherit from object, points to a reference)

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool byte char decimal double enum float int long sbyte short struct uint ulong ushort. There's a lot more number types. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

They store the address to an actual value being stored. It's different because it doesn't store an actual value.

C# is very picky, everything is a class. Switch case fallthrough is pretty neat.
