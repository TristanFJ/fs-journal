## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

A row is like a new entry in that table, like an object, and a column differentiates different types of information of that new entry, like keys/value pairs. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT NOT NULL primary key AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  creatorId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
)default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

The first will remove an entry in a table and the second will delete a whole table and its entries.
