## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

Ensures data is encrypted so nobody can intercept your information. 

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

EV is the most expensive to obtain and should be a priority for businesses processing transactions. OV verifies your organization and domain validation are real, and is a step down from EV. DV is a low level of encryption and is the quickest to receive. Wildcard applies to subdomains. UCC covers multiple domains under one certificate. SSL protects one domain. 

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

Not only will it protect your users (and you by extension), but it can improve SEO.
