## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Encoding an image into Base64 text, which can increase file size. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Increases file size. CPU overhead, caching issues because the browser can't cache base64, but it can cache images. It will hurt your search engine optimization.  

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Browsers can now handle making multiple requests so there's no need to encode the image in this fashion.
