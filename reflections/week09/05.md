# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Our application reached a point that we all seemed pretty pleased with. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

We were trying to modify the account object, and we were creating new properties such as xp and rank. We sent the account object through with the new properties but it was stripping them out. I looked in the function, and there was a sanitization function that stripped off anything not explicitly defined in that sanitizing function, so I added the new properties in their as well. That was kinda interesting and felt good to solve. 

- What are you struggling with?

I haven't had a lot of time to practice styling. I feel like I focus on functionality and that takes up the majority of my time. 

- What would you count as a victory?
