## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

It's like an area in the code where things are confined. So depending on how you're declaring variables, certain variables will only be accessible within certain blocks of code. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting brings the declared variable to the top of the scope. Be mindful of this when using variables that need to be accessed outside of its scope. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

`const` is used if you are sure the variable should never be changed, and `let` is used for variables that are mutable or known to be changed later. `var` is old and there shouldn't really be a need to use it.
