## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Console.log('my thing', function(example)). Errors are also printed to the console, pay attention to these as they will be your first hint as to what's unexpectedly happening. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

Elements tab. You can change your code and watch it change live on the screen without actually editing your code. You can also uncheck CSS elements and see exactly what's being applied. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

The debugger can be used to set breakpoints and watch step by step what exactly is happening in your code. Some things may be happening differently than you imagine, and it's possible to discover this by logging things to console, but it's not always the best method for bigger things.
