## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Just like writing English, programming is a creative act that requires foresight. You can't go to a location until you know where it is, and the best way to get there. Writing down in English what you think your logic should do and how you could go about implementing it will help you stay on track when actually writing the code. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

The internet is critical. It's very likely someone else has encountered your problem before. I relied on this heavily when I was exploring Linux a while ago, and it's so true that using a search engine properly is a skill in itself. Be specific when searching for questions, take specific note of the errors, and actually read the errors for that matter. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Not all untouched code is good code. Don't blindly copy something just because it exists, it may be working around a specific roadblock that shouldn't be replicated. 

Every code review is a learning opportunity. It's okay to be wrong, unless you don't try and learn the lesson. 

Source control, and commit messages, really matter. I sometimes skip this for smaller projects, but for anything slightly complicated it's very important. I need to learn more about Git. I tried to revert to a previous commit on my checkpoint, but had errors trying to revert, and ended up just copy-pasting a previous commit into a new one. It felt gross but I didn't want to worry about proper reversion. 

Take breaks. They do help, even if it seems like you're "giving up" for a moment.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Different people think about solving problems differently and it's very interesting to pair-program. Naming conventions are also very important for this teamwork.
