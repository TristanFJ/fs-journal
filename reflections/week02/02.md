## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function fcnName(a, b){
}

let fcnName2 = function(a, b){
}

let fcnName3 = (a, b) => {
}

Function declarations are hoisted. Function expressions are not. And an arrow function expression is a shorter way to write a function expression, and the difference here is you can't create their own `this` value. 


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

The parameter is like a sticky note or variable which says what we can pass in and what order, and the argument is the actual value being passed into the function. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Regular functions that are so commonly used that they were abstracted into reusable tools. So like forEach() can be used to loop over data without having to actually write the loop.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Using methods typically means you don't also need a for loop, as the method is already iterating over the data. I was trying to combine the two and it wasn't working.
