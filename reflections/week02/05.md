# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I am proud of the games made. I had a tiny bit of JavaScript experience so this has been fun. 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

For my rock paper scissors game, I did this thing where I was removing and then adding classes to show a red/green bar depending on if you won or lost, and then I saw Jonesey used a replace thing, which I was excited to see. Makes a lot more sense than removing and adding each time. 

- What are you struggling with?

Objects/maps and methods for manipulating them. I see how it's very important and useful but I'm not totally comfortable with them yet. 

- What would you count as a victory?

I got things to work, and even went further than I had anticipated with some things. The code isn't very pretty right now but it feels good to get things to work, and then clean it up a bit later.
