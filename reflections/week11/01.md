## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Creates a relationship between two classes. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Not all members are inherited. Constructors and finalizers aren't inherited, and whether something is visible or not depends on member's accessibility. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Something can't be accessed if it's private unless it's nested in the parent class. Protected members are only visible in child classes and internal members are visible in derived classes located in the same assembly as the parent.
