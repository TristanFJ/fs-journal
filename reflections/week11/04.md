## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I've loved my time at CodeWorks. Not only has the hands on experience and guidance been helpful in my education but I feel like I've learned how to create applications according to an industry standard, something that I'm not sure I could easily learn on my own. I can see the wisdom behind the pace and contents of what we learn and how it leads to the next step. I've also really enjoyed the people, getting to know my instructors and students. Part of me is sad it's almost over but I'm also excited to move on to new things.
