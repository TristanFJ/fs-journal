## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

Inserting arbitrary SQL code into a database that doesn't sanitize inputs. 

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

User input that isn't sanitized, cookies and HTTP headers can be modified and injected as well if not sanitized properly. 

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

Automated testing tools help us detect vulnerabilities. Making sure the user can only send exactly the data they're allowed to, like preventing certain characters that could be used to manipulate the database. Having a firewall can block basic attacks but shouldn't be the only defense. Limiting privileges is another line of defense.
